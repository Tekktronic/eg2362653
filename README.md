TestBed for C++ Programming projects
------------------------------------

This is a project repository for coding projects
up for commentary, review, and revision. Please
feel free to drop a line or two concerning the
projects and code posted here. All comments,
reviews, and revisions are welcome.

There is only one request I make upon collaborators.
As this is my learning space, please do not revise
any code posted outright. I would like to solicit
your input, but at the same time learn about your
input as well. Revising the code outright without
a modicum of explanation does not teach me HOW
to implement concepts. Allowing me the privilege
of learning HOW and WHY the revision works (works
better, works more efficiently, etc.) DOES.

As such, please enclose all proposed
changes as Comments inserted preceding the First
line which will be affected by the propsed revision/s

Thank you!!
